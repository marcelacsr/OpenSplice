<p>The support for ‘coherent changes’ enables a publishing application to change the value of several data-instances that could belong to the same or different topics and have those changes be seen ‘atomically’ by the readers. This is useful in cases where the values are inter-related (for example, if there are two data-instances representing the ‘altitude’ and ‘velocity vector’ of the same aircraft and both are changed, it may be useful to communicate those values in a way the reader can see both together; otherwise, it may e.g., erroneously interpret that the aircraft is on a collision course). </p>

<p><b><em>Communication Status</em></b></p>
<p>For each communication status, the StatusChangedFlag flag is initially set to false. It becomes true whenever that communication status changes. For each communication status activated in the mask, the associated PublisherListener operation is invoked and the communication status is reset to fase, as the listener implicitly accesses the status which is passed as a parameter to that operation. The status is reset prior to calling the listener, so if the application calls the Get&lt;status_name&gt;Status from inside the listener it will see the status already reset. An exception to this rule is the null listener, which does not reset the communication statuses for which it is invoked. The following statuses are applicable to the PublisherListener: </p>

<p>Be aware that the DDS.StatusKind.PublicationMatchStatus is not applicable when the infrastructure does not have the information available to determine connectivity. This is the case when OpenSplice is configured not to maintain discovery information in the Networking Service.

<p>Status bits are declared as a constant and can be used by the application in an OR operation to create a tailored mask.

<p>This operation blocks the calling thread until either all data written by all contained DataWriters is acknowledged by the local infrastructure, or until the duration specified by maxWait parameter elapses, whichever happens first. Data is acknowledged by the local infrastructure when it does not need to be stored in its IDataWriter’s local history. When a locally-connected subscription (including the networking service) has no more resources to store incoming samples it will start to reject these samples, resulting in their source DataWriters to store them temporarily in their own local history to be retransmitted at a later moment in time. In such scenarios, the WaitForAcknowledgments operation will block until all contained DataWriters have retransmitted their entire history, which is therefore effectively empty, or until the maxWait timeout expires, whichever happens first. In the first case the operation will return Ok, in the latter it will return Timeout. </p>
<p>Be aware that in case the operation returns Ok, the data has only been acknowledged by the local infrastructure: it does not mean all remote subscriptions have already received the data. However, delivering the data to remote nodes is then the sole responsibility of the networking service: even when the publishing application would terminate, all data that has not yet been received may be considered ‘on-route’ and will therefore eventually arrive (unless the networking service itself will crash). In contrast, if an <a class="el" href="a00084.html" title="IDataWriter allows the application to set the value of the sample to be published under a given ITopi...">IDataWriter</a> would still have data in its local history buffer when it terminates, this data is considered ‘lost’. This operation is intended to be used only if one or more of the contained DataWriters has its ReliabilityQosPolicyKind set to ReliableReliabilityQos Otherwise the operation will return immediately with Ok, since best-effort DataWriters will never store rejected samples in their local history: they will just drop them and continue business as usual. </p>
